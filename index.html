                <p>Welcome to my website! It doesn't look like much, but I do hope to continuously improve on it as I use it more and more. For now, I'll just leave some interests and or beliefs of mine here on the front page, but this is subject to change.</p>

                <h2>Call of Duty</h2>
                <p>*Sigh*</p>
                <p>Despite all the terrible parts of the game; the flamboyant skins, the grind the game makes you go through, the never decreasing prices, and that greedy company, among so, so many other reasons, I still really like the games. It pains me to admit I recently got a copy of Modern Warfare 3, but it is fun. Hopefully future installations are so bad I don't bother, or they actually turn things around (they won't). Regardless, at least I'm aware enough to be able to pick and choose my poisons.</p>

                <h2>Reading!</h2>
                <p>Despite having had spent less time reading as of late, I do enjoy the hobby. It's something that can be fun and or informative. Something you can stop at any time, and something that I can now do portably now that I have an eReader.</p>
                <p>I used to not like the idea of eReaders, and honestly, I still would like my very own copy for each book in printed form, but it's just more cost-effective, alongside it being vastly more portable. While I will indulge in a printed book every once a while, these two factors make it hard for me to consider switching back.</p>
                <p>I mostly read fiction; think adventure, coming-of-age, fantasy, stuff like that. I also do like my fair share of dystopias, though I do regret to admit I never finished 1984. Outside from that spectrum, I have started going with non-fiction, but it's too early to say what stuff draws me in quite yet. I just wanted to see what I was missing out on.</p>

            <section id="docking">
                <h2>Laptop vs Desktop</h2>
                <p>Recently, I've come across a slight fascination with laptops that have docking stations. It's quite interesting because I currently have one of each, and they are essentially totally segmented, outside from browser activities. It would be nice if they shared data, but I don't yet have a self-hosted cloud solution, so it's all USB drives and portable hard drives right now (not very fun).</p>
                <p>Given that's the case, and the fact that laptops have become significantly more powerful in later years, it's made me wonder if whenever I feel like upgrading, if I should instead just ball out on a really good laptop + a docking station, rather than having a comporable laptop with a beefy desktop by its side. There are tradebacks, of course; but that portability and unity (all your computing in one device), is a little hard to ignore</p>
                <p>Still, it seems a bit risky to go all out on a new workflow idea which may prove ineffective. I may try this on my current laptop and see if it's worth any more thought.</p>
