            Map of an Interesting Relic of Days Gone Past
          </h1>
          <p>
            This place used to be called Kowloon Walled City. It's a place that was,
            at one point in time, a completely unregulated, ungovernable city in the
            middle of Hong Kong. Unfortunately, (or fortunately, however you see it)
            this city was demolished after the Chinese government had enough of this
            legal limbo, and bulldozed the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only things left from The Walled City is the building the whole city
            was built around, the people who used to reside in the city, and a book
            documenting the innings and outings of people as the Chinese government
            started to forcefully move people out of there.
