              About Me
            </h2>
            <p>
              I'm a very motivated student passionate about personal computing and the
              dangers associated with it. My goals are to level up my knowledge, so I
              can better make use of my computing needs, and to be able to lend a hand
              to others that have a need to secure their organization, information, or
              anything else that falls under the jurisdiction of cybersecurity. Furthermore,
              if I can make it harder for malicious actors to prey on people, it will
              be a good step to making the web a safer place to be in.

              Languages
            </h2>
            <p>
              I am able to speak in both English and Spanish, alongside the aforementioned
              programming languages. Having this should help make me more versatile and
              able to work with larger groups of people.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Current Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
              Ultimately, right now my main goal is to attain as much experience I can
              as possible, and I can do that in a couple ways. I have had plans to run
              Gentoo on my laptop. This will help me have a greater understanding of
              the mechanisms behind what makes up an operating system. Further, I would
              also achieve my secondary aims at integrating closer to FLOSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to that, I will be having access to a private datacenter sometime
              by the end of next semester. My hopes are to leverage it to gain experience
              in server maintenance and security, alongside some courses from services
              such as Hack the Box, among other reputable ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, it would also be good for me to begin self-studying networking,
              as it is a field I will likely be learning about if not this upcoming semester,
              the one that follows. Given the nature of what I want to do and what my
              major requires of me, it would be prudent to start getting to work on what
              is likely my biggest foundational knowledge.
